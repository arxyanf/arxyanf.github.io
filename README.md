## 📦 Deployment

This portfolio is optimized for deployment on **Vercel**. The production build uses Vite's optimized build system.

To build for production locally:

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory.

To preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

For deployment, simply connect your GitHub repository to Vercel, and it will automatically deploy on every push to your main branch.

## 🎨 Code Architecture

The codebase is structured with reusable React components, data-driven sections, and a clean folder layout to keep things maintainable and scalable. Styling is done purely with Tailwind CSS utilities, and animations are implemented using modern React-friendly animation libraries for smooth and performant motion ✨.

Technologies used in this project include React (TypeScript), Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, shadcn/ui components, Three.js for 3D elements, and Git/GitHub. The project is developed on Linux 🐧 and follows standard frontend and tooling best practices.

👨‍💻 About Me  
I am a developer passionate about cloud infrastructure, DevOps practices, and backend systems. I enjoy working with Linux, Python, FastAPI, Flask, AWS, containers, automation, and CI/CD pipelines. I like building systems that are reliable, scalable, and boring in production (the good kind 😄).
